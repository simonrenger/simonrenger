I am Simon, a Game Programming student at Breda University of Applied Sciences, The Netherlands. I am striving for new opportunities to learn and innovate. I love my work as much as I love sharing knowledge with others. I do not shy away from a challenge that involves picking up different roles that move a project forward. I am mainly interested in backend system design as well as tool programming. I am striving towards becoming an engine and tools / network programmer in the future.

**I am looking for an internship starting September 2020.**
