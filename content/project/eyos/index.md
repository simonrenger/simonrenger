Eyos is a cross platfrom (Windows and Linux) targeting 2D multiplayer RTS. This project has not as goal to create the most impressive game, it is a learning oppurtunity for us to enhance our C++ knowlegde in terms of system design. For me personally it is an project to enhance my network programming skills. We are following the open development principle. The repositry can be found here [GitHub](https://github.com/Eothaun/Eyos).
