In this open world flight game my responsibilities vary from what is needed for the current state of development. Mainly I am focused with tools design and tools programming but also gameplay programming such as the camera. This project allows me to dive into Unityâ€™s new Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS) due to its massive performance promises especially in terms of level streaming.
