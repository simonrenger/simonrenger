Matze is my maze generator tool chain consisting out of multiple maze generator algorithms. It contains a command line tool to generate mazes. The command line tool is written in C# (.Net Core).

This project was born to give me a playground to practice API design in C# and C++. The main goal for this project is it to create a similar API in my C++ Lib as well as in my C# lib.
