The tomorrow engine is a cross platform C++ game framework which allows the creation of deterministic linear card games. The player had to fight the opponent and the 3 monsters in the game. The game we created with this was called Raptoads.

## My main responsibilities

Besides being the Tech lead / Team lead of the 11 programmers, I have been in charge for the core architecture. Besides this I have been responsible for implementing and designing the extensive tooling and pipeline for content creation, content management. The tooling was created in web technologies (electron & SQL Database), this allowed us for quick and rapid iterations.
