The tomorrow engine is a cross platform C++ game framework which allows the creation of deterministic linear card games. It has an extensive tooling written in JavaScript & Electron. I was in charge for the core Framework design as well as for the Tool design and execution. The unpublished game we build with it is called raptoads.
