I am striving for new opportunities to learn and innovate. I love my work as much as I love sharing knowledge with others. I do not shy away from a challenge that involves picking up different roles that move a project forward. I am mainly interested in backend system design as well as tool programming. I am striving towards becoming an engine and tools / network programmer in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I am looking for an internship starting September 2020.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
