It is your job to complete quests given by the gods and the islands inhabitants in order to rebuild your boat.\n   Game teaser, basic game overview\n My main responsibilities I am mainly responsible for the QA pipeline and the Jenkins set up. I created a Jenkins Utility library. This Jenkins groovy script collection helps us create the QA pipeline we want on the school\u0026rsquo;s Jenkins server. The library contains a collection of functions to communicate with Helix Swarm, Mantis and Discord. It supports the automated testing pipeline in Unreal Engine. Furthermore, it can pack and build UE4 projects.\nBesides, I have created a prototype of a Commit Testing Tool in WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and Material Design for WPF.\nP4CommitTester - prototype The purpose of this tool is it to test local or online Perforce changelists before they can be submitted or turned into a Swarm review. The tool has a simple toml configuration file in which the automated tests can be specified (e.g. unit tests, map tests/ funcionality tests).\nOne can also define pre/post steps. They will be executed before the actual tests run e.g. shelve all other changelists. This set up makes it possible for the tool to work with any kind of engine or software. When tests are finished, the tool will check the return code of the application and react appropriately (most test applications return EXIT_FAILURE on failure).\nCurrently, the tool can only communicate with the Jenkins API to run online tests / builds.\nImages    Changelist Overview        List of all possible changelists. The default changelist is excluded because it is not really a changelist.       Selected Changelist Details        You can shelve (if it is a shelved changelist), unshelve and test the current changelist.       Test configuration        Toml file to configure the tool to run tests.       Test Results        In case the tests were ok the user can create a review or commit directly.

The development of this project is open and can be found on GitHub.\nMy main responsibilities The network architecture\nI am in charge for the network architecture which supports the synchronization of millions of entities via the network. The chosen architecture is a peer to peerish server-client approach, with deterministic lock step, as described in the article Age of Empire Network Architecture and in the book Architecting Networked Games by Joshua L. Glazer and Sanjay Madhav. The host starts up a dedicated server on their machine and that one confirms the gameplay.\nQA Pipeline\nI am working with GitHub Actions. It verifies that our game can be built on Windows (msvc) and Linux (our test environment is Ubuntu) with GCC9 and Clang9 tool chain. Our code gets also tested and verified with clang-tidy and clang format every time someone pushes.

A lecture which uses minecraft to illustrate how abstract thinking works as well as how we can improve communication internally.   C++ type deduction In three workshops I have covered the basics of the C++ type deduction: template type deduction, auto type deduction, decltype deduction, decltype auto deduction, lambda type deduction.   C++ Compiler and linker steps This presentation explained the compiler steps in C++ and the linker steps.   Allocators are handles to the heap This workshop introduced the concept of polymorphic memory allocations in C++17 and how to use them as well as how to implement them in C++14. Besides, there was a brief introduction on Memory Management.   C++ special member function rules In this talk I covered the special member function rules in C++.   C# for designers and artists This is a workshop series of 16 weeks in which me and 2 other students taught C# to fellow Design and Art students. We ran this course in year 2 and also in year 3. We iterated on the idea and changed the concept to a Quest-based learning environment. This allows students to progress at their own pace because they have an overview on how they progress.   C++ Memory Managment: Introduction In two parts I introduced Memory Managment in C++ and the underlying concepts.   C++ Memory Managment: Write your own STL compatible allocator This workshop explained how to implement in C++ 14 an STL compatible polymorphic like allocator and memory resource environment.
