This is a great way of learning new skills and sharing the gained knowlegde with others. It also allows for a great flow of feedback. This is why I initiated the C++ learning comminity at our school (called C++ Guild)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the last two years I have been giving various lectures and workshops on the following topics:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Lecture / Workshop&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Description&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>How do programmers think?&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A lecture which uses minecraft to illustrate how abstract thinking works as well as how we can improve communication internally.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>C++ type deduction&lt;/td>
&lt;td>In three workshops I have covered the basics of the C++ type deduction: template type deduction, auto type deduction, decltype deduction, decltype auto deduction, lambda type deduction.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>C++ Compiler and linker steps&lt;/td>
&lt;td>This presentation explained the compiler steps in C++ and the linker steps.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Allocators are handles to the heap&lt;/td>
&lt;td>This workshop introduced the concept of polymorphic memory allocations in C++17 and how to use them as well as how to implement them in C++14. Besides, there was a brief introduction on Memory Management.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>C++ special member function rules&lt;/td>
&lt;td>In this talk I covered the special member function rules in C++.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>C# for designers and artists&lt;/td>
&lt;td>This is a workshop series of 16 weeks in which me and 2 other students taught C# to fellow Design and Art students. We ran this course in year 2 and also in year 3. We iterated on the idea and changed the concept to a Quest-based learning environment. This allows students to progress at their own pace because they have an overview on how they progress.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>C++ Memory Managment: Introduction&lt;/td>
&lt;td>In two parts I introduced Memory Managment in C++ and the underlying concepts.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>C++ Memory Managment: Write your own STL compatible allocator&lt;/td>
&lt;td>This workshop explained how to implement in C++ 14 an STL compatible polymorphic like allocator and memory resource environment. This workshop was targeted for Windows and Playstation 4 and was held in 4 parts.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
