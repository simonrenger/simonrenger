# About me

I am Simon, a Game Programming student at [Breda University of Applied
Sciences](https://www.buas.nl/en/games), The Netherlands. I am striving for new opportunities to
learn and innovate. I love my work as much as I love sharing knowledge with others. I do not shy
away from a challenge that involves picking up different roles that move a project forward. I am
mainly interested in backend system design as well as tool programming. I am striving towards
becoming an engine and tools / network programmer in the future.

# Currently

I am currently doing my internship at [OurMachinery](https://ourmachinery.com/)
